Example Jenkins jobs

This repo will be of a set of Jenkins jobs, intended as an example
or starting setup for the standard dev-stage-prod workflow, backups,
testing, and a few other things.

Each job is a directory that can be copied to your 
/var/lib/jenkins/jobs directory.  You will probably have to set
permissions -- "sudo chown -R jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/jobs" will
usually do the trick.
